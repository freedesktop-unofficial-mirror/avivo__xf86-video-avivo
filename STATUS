VT switching:
 - Completely broken.
 - http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/tmp/textmode.diff fixes.

BIOS reading:
 - None.

TMDS:
 - Both heads work.

VGA:
 - Both heads work.
 - ... but can't be detected.

PLLs:
 - Needs to be worked out.  Works if fglrx/BIOS sets a mode with the same
   clock first.

I2C:
 - Jerome has the registers for this: should be pretty easy to get going
   and hook up to DDC.

LVDS:
 - http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/tmp/avivo_lvds.diff makes it work for
   the MacBook Pro.  Need to look harder at the TMDS mystery registers:
   presumably preserving state will help, rather than cargo-culting.

pciaccess:
 - Completely untested.

TV:
 - Nothing yet.

Mode validation:
 - None.

RandR 1.2:
 - None.

Acceleration:
 - None.

Register descriptions:
 - http://nouveau.cvs.sourceforge.net/nouveau/doc/rules-ng/rules-ng-format.txt?revision=HEAD
   describes the format Nouveau are probably going with.
